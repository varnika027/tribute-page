        <h3>October 15, 1931 - July 27, 2015</h3><br>

        <p><p><strong>About: </strong><em> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </em>better known as A.P.J. Abdul Kalam(15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was the <em>11th President of India </em>from <em>2002 to 2007</em>. A career scientist turned statesman, Kalam
            was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, and studied <em>physics </em>and <em>aerospace engineering</em>. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the <em>Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) </em>and
            <em>Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) </em>and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the <em>Missile Man of India </em>for his work on the development
            of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in <em>India's Pokhran-II </em>nuclear tests in <em>1998</em>, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974. Kalam
            was elected as the 11th President of India in <em>2002 </em>with the support of both the ruling <em>Bharatiya Janata Party </em>and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President," he returned to his civilian
            life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour. While delivering a lecture at the <em>Indian Institute of Management Shillong</em>,
            Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on <em>27 July 2015, </em>aged <em>83</em>. Thousands including national-level dignitaries attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of <em>Rameshwaram, </em>where he was buried with
            full state honours.
